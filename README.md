# Overview
In this project we are tasked with analyzing Amazon products and the reviews that they have received from the Amazon memebers paid Vines program. We will have to transfer raw data from Amazon's RDS system into pgAdmin where we will create DataFrame tables. After we create the tables in pgAdmin they will be exported into PySpark were we will further clean up our data in order to get how many reviews were by paid subscribers and how many were from unpaid subscribers.
